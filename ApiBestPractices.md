# Best Practices & Notes

- Always keep your secret token safe. Do not expose it in public repositories.
- Use your dashboard to monitor quota and request status.
- Only submit URLs that you control and want to prerender.
- For large batches, consider splitting requests to avoid hitting quota limits.
