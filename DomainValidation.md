2. Follow the instructions for your chosen method.
3. Once completed, click "Validate" in your dashboard.
4. Page Replica will check for the verification and confirm your ownership.

## Step-by-step validation process

1. **Create a TXT file**  
   Name the file:

```
page-replica.txt
```

2. **Add your validation token**  
   Copy and paste the provided token into the file:

```
[your public token here]
```

3. **Upload the file**  
   Place `page-replica.txt` in the root directory of your website.  
   The file should be accessible at:

```
https://yourdomain.com/page-replica.txt
```

4. **Complete validation**  
   Once the file is uploaded, return to the dashboard and click the **Validate** button.  
   If you wish to remove the site, click **Delete**.

If there are any errors, they will be displayed in the dashboard.  
After successful validation, you can start tracking and monitoring your site's uptime and performance.
