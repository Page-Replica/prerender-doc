# Getting Started

Page Replica lets you create a static copy of your website for search engines and social media platforms that do not support JavaScript. It uses a headless browser to render your site and host the static copy on Page Replica's servers.

## Why do I need it?

Search engines and social media platforms may not fully render JavaScript, which can affect your site's indexing and sharing. Page Replica solves this by serving a static copy, improving your site's visibility and performance for bots.

## First steps

Start using Page Replica in just a few steps:

1. **Sign up** for an account on Page Replica (free).
2. [**Add your domain**](AddDomain.md)
3. [**Validate your ownership**](DomainValidation.md)
4. [**Create requests to prerender**](PrerenderRequests.md)
5. [**Generate a preview & see what happens next**](PrerenderPreview.md)
6. [**Redirect bots to your static copy**](BotRedirection.md)
