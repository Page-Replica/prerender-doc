## Prerequisites

1. [Sign up for a free Page Replica account](https://page-replica.com) and get your unique site ID.
2. Register your website's domain in the Page Replica dashboard.
3. Request pre-rendering of your website's pages from the dashboard.

## Running Locally

Start your Meteor app with your settings file:

```sh
meteor --settings settings.json
```

---

## Usage

- The package works automaticallyâ€”no manual NGINX or Cloudflare setup needed.
- It detects bots and fetches prerendered/cached responses from Page Replica for them.
- Human visitors and regular browsers see your normal Meteor app.

---

## Testing Your Implementation

To verify your setup, you can:

- Visit the [Page Replica testing guide](https://page-replica.com/doc/test-config).
- Use a tool like curl to simulate a bot:
  ```sh
  curl -A "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)" https://yourdomain.com
  ```
  You should see the prerendered HTML if everything is working.
