# Create Requests to Prerender

After verifying your domain, you can submit requests to prerender your site’s pages. This process allows you to generate static versions of your pages for bots and crawlers.

## Add Page URLs

You can add pages to prerender in two ways:

- **Manual Entry:**  
  Enter each page URL (one per line) in the provided textarea.  
  Example:

  ```
  https://yourdomain.com/page1
  https://yourdomain.com/page2
  ```

- **Import from Sitemap:**  
  Enter the URL to your `sitemap.xml` and click **Import URLs** to automatically add all pages listed in your sitemap.

Your quota determines how many requests you can submit. If you reach your quota, you won’t be able to add more pages until it’s increased.
